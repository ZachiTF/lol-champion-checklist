A simple checklist to track your personal progress on champions in the video game league of legends.

Can be a handy tool to remember on which champions you have already won in Arena or whatever league/personal challenge you are currently grinding for.

Allows the creation and naming of multiple instances of the list; in case you are grinding on multiple fronts at the same time!

## Features
- Filter champions by region and properties (abilities, mechanics)
- Multiple tracking pages/lists
- Dark/Light theme support
- Import/Export functionality
- Progress tracking with visual indicators

## Data Structure
Champion metadata is stored in `/data` folder:
- `champion-regions.json` - Maps champions to lore regions
- `champion-properties.json` - Champion abilities and properties

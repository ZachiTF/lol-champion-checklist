A simple checklist to track your personal progress on champions in the video game league of legends.

Can be a handy tool to remember on which champions you have already won in Arena or whatever league/personal challenge you are currently grinding for.

Allows the creation and naming of multiple instances of the list; in case you are grinding on multiple fronts at the same time!
